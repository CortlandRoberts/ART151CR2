<!-- Who Cares by Janet Ford
‘From the #100DaysofBipolar project. This image depicts how it feels to be both depressed and manic. In both states you have a “who cares” mindset, yet both are completely different. When you are depressed you are unable to care about anything. Life has lost any sort of meaning. When you are manic you don’t care about anything either. But it’s more of being unable to think past the current moment. You don’t think or care about the future or it’s consequences.’
